rank_centrality.py contains the code for both real and synthetic data experiments. Comment out the appropriate sections to switch, clearly labelled in code file.

For real world data, use the reformatted data present in ../real_data_extract/ to run.

For synthetic data runs, use the datafiles generated by the synthetic data experiments in the cpp_code directory to run. This dependency is present to make sure all algorithms use the same data.
